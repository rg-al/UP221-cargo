    "Shifting gears on our project, weâ€™ve decided to focus our research and project on a timewise longitudinal warehouse analysis in Ontario. We are more confident in being able to use point data within one city instead of line data across an entire county. We believe it will be easier to explore and explain patterns related to the effects of freight looking at warehouses instead of freeways. We met with Chris for more guidance, and are currently working on re-working our proposal. This Sunday we will be exploring some of the new data to narrow down our scope. We will be conducting a historical and literature review, as well as incorporating a map of community response to warehouses. We are also exploring mapping trends in warehouses and its related health and economic effects, producing a limited forecast for the near future. We are also considering creating regression models in the future to see if there are statistically significant effects which arise in response to warehouse expansion."
